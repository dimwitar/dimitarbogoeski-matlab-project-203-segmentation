# Project details
This project uses MATLAB's **Video Labeler App** and **Computer Vision Toolbox** to segment and label vehicles in a traffic video.  
We applied automation using the **Point Tracker (KLT)** algorithm to reduce manual labeling effort and exported the results as a `groundTruth` object.

**Key features:**
- Manual labeling of first visible car frame
- Semi-automated bounding box tracking across frames
- Exported dataset for use in deep learning workflows
